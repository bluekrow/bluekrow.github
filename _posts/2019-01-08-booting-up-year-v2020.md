## Input data, or things that happened last year
Amongst all the things good and bad, that happened last year I'll remember the following the most:

#### The Platform Team rises
As a mean to carry on with the tasks that would be our first steps in the path of the continuous delivery, we agreed to assemble a team that would have no strings attached to the product priorization.

With this strategy we meant to liberate the product teams, to do, you know, the product, meanwhile Platform would set up the proper framework and tooling to advance.

And then we learned some valuable lessons...

#### Time to POC
We began generating POC projects, as a mean transfer the knowledge about the new tech stack. We loved and hated .NetCore, GrayLog, Dapper, Entity Framework, and at the end only love remained. This is what we intended to transmit to our colleagues.

#### POCs were not enough
We noticed that we needed to leverage our knowledge, for that we summoned a great Warlock of Crafting, who teached a newly formed Trainers Guild, in the path of the Softwaree Crafting. Armed with this new knowledge and eager to share it, we embarqued on a series o sessions for the development teams.
And for a time, it was good.

#### Iterations
At short time, we realized that the training pace was unsustainable for whole teams to be absent, so we tried a new agenda, where devs were combined in mixed groups, so only two or three would be absent during training at the same time.
And for a time, it was good.
We also noticed that there was part of the transformation delegated to the teams that was being neglected, for the right reasons nevertheless.

So we changed one more time...

## Output data, or lessons learned
We concluded, after some time, that The Platform Eye should focus on transformation pain points inside the teams, so transformation could be achieved.
