## Customize your theme

But if you don't know where to start I can recommend you to import a starting theme from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).

* Go on [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) and choose a theme that you like.
* Using the top bar, download its `_variables.scss` and `_bootswatch.scss` files.
* Copy the content of `_variables.scss` in `_sass/_variables.scss`.
* Copy the content of `_bootswatch.scss` in `_sass/_bootstrap_customization.scss`.

## Known issues

* Bootstrap 4 should normally be post-processed using [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer). Even if it is possible to use autoprefixer with Jekyll, it is not possible with a classic Github Pages installation without adding some kind of pre-processing before publication. Since this project mostly aims compatibility with Github Pages I prefer to keep it that way. The consequences of this choice is that some Bootstrap features could not work as expected on older browsers.

## Other projects
